===================

Proof of concept on how to build an API out of any task that requires an operations team to maintain or operate.
My goals? To facilitate the dream of automating the manual dirty parts of delivering operational services as an operations engineer or administrator. I dream of delegating instant-delivery of tasks to the people who need them -- developers, architects, administrators. That, and solving my carpel tunnel at the same time *drum riff*
