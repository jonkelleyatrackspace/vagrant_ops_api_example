# Simple playbook for version locking packages on a host. Requires a list of packages.
#
# Packages can be locked at a specified version using the "packages_to_lock" variable:
#
#   ansible-playbook -Kki hosts yum_versionlock.yml --extra-vars '{"packages_to_lock": ["repose"]}'
#
# Packages can be unlocked using the "packages_to_unlock" variable:
#
#   ansible-playbook -Kki hosts yum_versionlock.yml --extra-vars '{"packages_to_unlock": ["repose"]}'
#
# Or --extra-vars can be loaded from a JSON or YAML file with the @ syntax:
#
#   ansible-playbook -Kki hosts yum_versionlock.yml --extra-vars "@versionlock.json"
#
# A sample YAML file for the package list would look like this:
#
#   ---
#   packages_to_versionlock:
#     - repose
---
- hosts: all
  sudo: yes
  tasks:
    - include: tasks/yum/versionlock.yml
